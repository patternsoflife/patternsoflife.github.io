Patterns of Life is a research and development project by [Parnassia Groep] and
[Redesigning Psychiatry]. Its aim is to study new forms of diagnostic and
prognostic cocreation between clients and professionals in the field of mental
health care.

To this end, a blended care application is being designed, in collaboration
with [PsyQ] and [Label A]. The application allows clients to create intuitive
visualisations of problem-sustaining patterns in their lives.

This interface is combined with an extensive questionnaire, featuring a wide
range of newly formulated questions. These were designed to be less
stigmatising, while also being more suitable to transdiagnostic analysis, in
comparison to existing psychiatric diagnostic instruments.

User data from these designs will be analysed by the Mark van der Gaag Research
Centre, at [Parnassia Groep] and [Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam], in order to
establish a scientific basis for future research and clinical practice.
